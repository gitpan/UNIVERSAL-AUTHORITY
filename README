NAME
    UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY - adds an AUTHORITY method to UNIVERSAL

SYNOPSIS
     if (HTML::HTML5::Writer->AUTHORITY ne HTML::HTML5::Builder->AUTHORITY)
     {
       warn "Closely intertwined modules with different authors!\n";
       warn "There may be trouble ahead...";
     }

     # Only trust STEVAN's releases
     Moose->AUTHORITY('cpan:STEVAN'); # dies if doesn't match

DESCRIPTION
    This module is deprecated: use UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY::Lexical instead.

    This module adds an "AUTHORITY" function to the "UNIVERSAL" package,
    which works along the same lines as the "VERSION" function. Because it
    is defined in "UNIVERSAL", it becomes instantly available as a method
    for any blessed objects, and as a class method for any package.

    The authority of a package can be defined like this:

     package MyApp;
     BEGIN { $MyApp::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:JOEBLOGGS'; }

    The authority should be a URI identifying the person, team, organisation
    or trained chimp responsible for the release of the package. The
    pseudo-URI scheme "cpan:" is the most commonly used identifier.

  "UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY"
    Called with no parameters returns the authority of a CPAN release.

  "UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY($test)"
    If passed a test, will croak if the test fails. The authority is tested
    against the test using something approximating Perl 5.10's smart match
    operator. (Briefly, you can pass a string for "eq" comparison, a regular
    expression, a code reference to use as a callback, or an array reference
    that will be grepped.)
